# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This dashboard serves to provide a user with weather information for a city. The app provides current data as well as the five day forecast. Building this app allowed me to practice working with server side APIs. While building the app I learned about forEach functions. This was a new idea to me but I thought it could be utilized when getting the local storage.

I also learned more about fetching data. I realized how much work it can be to take the data that comes in and actually append it into your app. It isn't hard but just a lot of lines of code.
